**General Description**

This repository contains materials and algorithm implementations that were used during the numerical integration laboratory work. The main goal of the work is to acquire practical skills and theoretical knowledge of numerical integration methods and their implementation using the Python programming language.

**Introduction**

Numerical integration is an important topic in numerical methods and mathematical analysis, which allows you to calculate the value of definite integrals using numerical approximations. In this laboratory work, various methods of numerical integration and their practical implementation are considered.

**Methods and Techniques** 

As part of this work, the following methods and techniques were considered and implemented:

* Method of Left Rectangles
* Simpson's method
* Runge's Rule for Error Estimation
* Substitution for Trimming the Boundaries of an Integral
